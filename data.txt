Whats Project PS?
Project PS is a mod that tries to bring another way to see or play SSF2, with more fun, "complexity" and a little lack of balance :)

What have in Project PS?
First, we have the new characters (Two Link, Roy, Vegeta, Tetromino,Cloud,Terry, Anakin,Spiderman,Vergil,Kira,Zero,King Dedede, Yu, Piccolo)
After that we have Multiple changes in each character, whether from just Stats to New Movesets
If you're sick of playing with the same moveset, remember that some characters have alternative Movesets chosen by their costumes (Metal Sonic, PS Ganondorf, PS Bowser, Kage, Ken, Dark Samus and others)
and last but not least, we have the Air Grabs, Melee Airdodges, Airdashes(Air Dodge Cancel), Wavedash, Parry Disable and Final Hit Effect as New Mechanics

we hope that u like this new patch ;)
